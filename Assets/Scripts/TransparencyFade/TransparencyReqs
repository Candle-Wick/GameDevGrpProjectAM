Code generates cylinder between player and camera
raycast,
radious is half height of player, so it checks the entire parts of player, and extends to the sides about half height
Any object inside it, allowed to be transparent, needs to become transparent
Needs to stop being transparent, when no longer inside.

Could also use vector maths



To check not being transparent:
Ways:
Object checks self, not inside array
Flush array every frame? Is O(n)


Order of operations
FixedUpdate does not work the way you think, its not actually garunteed to run at the fixed rate- https://forum.unity.com/threads/the-truth-about-fixedupdate.231637/
Update
Camera (flushes array first? Unsure if needed) checks, puts every collidor that is between it and player into array, tells those objects that they need to become transparent
Object checks, am in array up to number of array? If not, turn off transparency
